# Aim : To Implement Dictionary Using Binary Search Tree

# Description of project:
Dictionaries can be implemented using a binary search tree.  A binary search tree is a binary tree such that each node stores a key of a dictionary.
Key 'K' of a node is always greater than the keys present in its left sub tree.
Similarly, the key 'K' of a node is always lesser than the keys present in its right subtree.
Implementation of lexicon - which will read a list of words and their definitions. Users can look for their meaning and their synonyms. Insertion of new words, searching and  deletion can also be performed. We are using the concepts of data structures such as trees, arrays ,linked lists etc.
